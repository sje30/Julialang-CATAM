# Julialang-CATAM
Developing Julia language resources for CATAM

This repository collects our work starting in 2019 to develop Julia resources for the CATAM module in mathematics.
We aim to develop resources not only for Cambridge undergraduates, but those that will be widely useful.

# Current provision

# Mailing list
We have a mailing list for open discussion <https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/maths-julialang>


# Useful resources

[David Sander's current Julia course](https://github.com/dpsanders/6.S083)


# Random ideas that could become useful mini projects

introduction: logistic equation, following May 1976.

beginner: Newton Raphsen, sieve method for primes.

advanced: automatic differentiation, Turing patterns, distribution of primes


Key will be to provide lots of exercises (and nice solutions)


## What topics need to be covered?

Basics of language: loops, conditionals, functions

Basic types:

making own types:

vectorisation,
efficiencies
I/O

## What should be covered somewhere but that we may not get time to do:
error  handling.
